# Bubble

Bubble is for anyone who wants to make managing their money easier. With all the expenses we have nowadays,
it's easy to lose track. On top of that, we also want to set money aside, for example, to go on vacation or 
treat ourselves to a new smartphone. Bubble makes this easier, as users can create and manage savings goals.
